Add project images here. Recommended structure:

- project-slug/
  - 1.jpg (featured image)
  - thumb.jpg (thumbnail)

Use web-optimized formats (webp/jpg) and keep filenames lowercase and URL-safe (dashes, no spaces).

Example: public/images/projects/campus-study-spot/featured.jpg

Placeholders are fine; the app will reference images at /images/projects/<project-slug>/featured.jpg
